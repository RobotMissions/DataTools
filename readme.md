In this repository, you will find all of the tools related to parsing, editing, visualising, and generally doing things with the data!

The robot's data includes its on-board log that gets saved to the sd card, as well as the imagery data. As we're working on getting the data sorted from this summer, we'll be looking in to what will be useful data to share with the community.

This repository is a work in progress, with a big thanks to @bjb for her work on making the tools for the data!
